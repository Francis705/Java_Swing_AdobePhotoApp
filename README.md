# Java_Swing_AdobePhotoApp
This is just an application I made in order to learn Java Swing for a User Interface desing class check out this youtube video for a demo here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=muIB4jTwWKQ
The files that are important here are 
MainClass.java (This is where the main Jframe is made)
photoComponent.java(This is where all the pictures are manipulated),
lightTable.java (Where all photoComponent objects are manipulated in the gridview mode)
magnet.java(Where my magnet objects are handled)
textfield.java (gives the ability to annotate the back of the photos with a text box)
